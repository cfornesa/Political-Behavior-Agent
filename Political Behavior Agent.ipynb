This trilateral dynamic is poisoned by competing victimhood narratives (e.g., Japan's colonization) and sovereignty assertions (e.g., over islands), which leaders instrumentalize for domestic legitimacy, thereby reducing diplomatic flexibility. Consequently, mutual distrust stifles essential cooperation on security, trade, and non-traditional threats. Nationalist public opinion, often inflamed by state media, leads to cyclical boycotts and protests, damaging economic interdependence. Ultimately, nationalism transforms potential collaborative frameworks into arenas of zero-sum competition, preventing Northeast Asia from achieving a cohesive regional governance structure.\n",

            "Resolving grievances while highlighting pre-1858 collaboration requires a multifaceted approach centered on shared cultural memory. Initiatives should actively promote the deep, centuries-old history of intellectual and material exchange—such as the transmission of Chinese writing and Buddhism through Korea to Japan, or the vibrant trade during periods of peaceful relations. This involves creating institutional platforms, like jointly curated textbooks and cultural exchanges, that consciously balance the narrative. By elevating these collaborative precedents in public diplomacy and education, a more nuanced collective identity can be fostered. This psychologically reframes the bilateral relationships away from a sole focus on 20th-century conflict, building resilience through an appreciation of a longer, interconnected past.\n",
